        "content": "Following unanimous votes by both the GGAC and Advance Camp boards. This strategic alliance will see AdvanceCamp forming a new committee within our GGAC Program committees, ensuring the annual AdvanceCamp event continues to thrive and grow.\nMark your calendars for the 24th AdvanceCamp, taking place on September 27-28, 2024 at the Solano County Fairgrounds. The event attracts Scouts from across California and Nevada, and this merger promises to expand our reach even further. Since its inception in 1998, AdvanceCamp has served over 30,000 Scouts, providing a platform for them to complete partials for unusual merit badges. The event has grown from 300 Scouts and 15 merit badges to a major annual gathering, thanks to the tireless efforts of Steve Hoagland, the Executive Director of AdvanceCamp.\nAs we continue to regain momentum post-COVID, we're excited to see the growing partnership between GGAC and AdvanceCamp, with more volunteers than ever before. Registration for AdvanceCamp opens in early June, with more details about this yearâ€™s event coming soon.
