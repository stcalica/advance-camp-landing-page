                A Scout is Prepared! Please make sure you bring your printed Merit Badge Worksheet(s) with you to camp! These are a tool for your success. You are encouraged to use merit badge worksheets available at usscouts.org. It is highly recommended that you print out the worksheets for each merit badge you plan to work on and bring them along with you to camp.<br /><br />
                Special Requirements: Many Merit Badges require that the scout have permission slips, special clothes or shoes, extra clothes, etc. Please check the details of every Merit Badge and make sure that your scouts are prepared to work on that badge.<br /><br />
